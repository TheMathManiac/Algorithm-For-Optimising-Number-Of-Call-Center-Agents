# Algorithm-For-Optimising-Number-Of-Call-Center-Agents

## What Is The Purpose Of The Algorithm?

A minimum service level for each hour of service must be maintained. However, by implementing a simple algorithm, I can find a way to reduce the number of agents across the day 
to minimize service times as much as possible and saving on costs. 

## Technologies implemented?

Python

## Theory Supporting The Algorithm? 

Assuming the arrival of calls within a given time period are poisson distributed
